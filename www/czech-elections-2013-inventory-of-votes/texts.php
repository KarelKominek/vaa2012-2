Therefore, these situations are treated as voting “No” when calculating the match.</p>
  	<p>In parliamentary votes where a majority of all members of parliament is necessary (e.g. amending the Constitution or overruling a veto of the Senate or the president), abstention has the same effect on the result of voting as voting “No”. Absence is therefore treated as voting “No” when calculating the match.</p>',
